# Orion-Moves VR project

 * Synopsis : Help Orion the hunter creating your own moves nebulae. Stars intensity depend on the intensity of each movement. The nebulae is distibuted over a Cube.

 * Pedagogical principle : The major aspect is a rigourous ludo-pedagogical repr√©sentation of motion and movement. As shows the figure below, A gesture contains a set of data sent  using a **Movuino** or **Smartphone** UDP streamer (see https://github.com/MehHam/Moves-Remote). A set of data is given by  "Acc\t" + Input.acceleration.ToString() +"\t"+ "Gyro\t" + gyro.gravity.ToString()" and locating the position of a star in the "Orion Nebulae" depends on the Gyro coordinates (locates the intensity /color of the gesture star), its diameter is correlated to the acceleration vector magnitude. Finally, The star transparency depends on the weighted occurences at that position.
